# Durak game

2-6 players
Total 36 cards
4 suits: ♠️ ♣️ ♥️ ♦️
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A (Jack, Queen, King, Ace)

## Rules

Each player takes 6 random cards
Top card on the deck is open
Top open card's suit is strongest suit
And this card will go to player's hands last of all

The goal of the game: to get rid of all the cards in your hands at the end of the deck

Who starts the game: player with smallest rank of strongest suit or player with any card with strongest suit (if other players haven't got strongest suit at all) - attacker
If it's not the first game in a row, the loser of the last game became the first defender and the attack is initiated by the player sitting to his right (clockwise)

During one turn:

## (a) Classic mode

-attacker: chose cards from his hands
-defender: find in hands card stronger then card on the table and put it over attacker's card
Attacker can add cards with the same number or letter as a continuation of his attack while total number of attacker's cards on the table <=6

## (b) Transferable mode

The same rules as in classic mode but defender can reflect the attack if he has in his hands card with the same number or letter. If defender did it, he became an atacker and atacker must cover the cards on the table

After turn:
Attacker gets the cards from deck up to 6. If total number of the cards in deck is less then nessesary, he takes all of them. After defender does the same
The roles are shifted clockwise by one. If number of players == 2: the defender and attacker switch thei roles

If during one turn defender hasn't got suitable cards and he can't cover all attacker's cards, he must pick up all cards from the table to his hands. After it attacker gets the cards from deck up and make one extra turn as an attacker
